# Development of an Audio-Voice Modulator

This project is a digital voice modulator using the **Librosa** Python package, which is used for music and audio analysis.

We used an anime Filipino parody, Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin), to test the simulator. With the following characters:
* Eren Yeager voice-over of Selwyn Landayan
* Reiner Braun voice-over of Sam Ryan Ruiz
* Falco Grice voice-over of Jerome Marbebe

> In modulating the voice of the voice actors, we used the `shift_pitch` feature of the Librosa to modify the voice to set the right voice for the character.

## Process Documentation:
